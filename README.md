# KenKen

This program solves the game KenKen using Depth First Search. Takes file input from user and places values on a 2D-array ("board") using recursive call within a for-loop. Both the unsolved and solved boards are displayed using Java's Swing GUI.

Practice with DFS, 2D-arrays, HashMaps, and Java's Swing GUI.

Test file structure:
The first line is the size of the board. Each new line corresponds to one Cage. The first int is the Cage value, followed by the Cage operator, and then the indexs of each of the Cage's cells.
