# KenKen

This program solves the game KenKen using Depth First Search. Takes file input from user, builds 2D-array, places values on 2D array ("board") using recursive call within a for-loop

Practice with DFS, 2D arrays, HashMaps, and Java's Swing GUI.

Test file structure:
The first line is the size of the board. Each new line corresponds to one Cage. The first int is the Cage value, followed by the Cage operator, and then the indexs of each of the Cage's cells.
